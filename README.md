Live Simulator: 2 Extension provides various functions that needs to be run in C side, and lists available feature supported.

* Video encoding

* Audio mixing (but not very decent algo)

* FFT

* Audio decoding (any format)

The list will be updated as Live Simulator: 2 needs more features.
